You wake up one day in your abode, surrounded by your possesions and creature comforts, really wanting a good hunk of food.
You walk outside in the crisp autumn air, leaves already fallen and crunching underfoot. The chill is growing with every passing day but you enjoy it.
After all winter is the season where you just sit in your den and eat. Who doesn't want that?
The walk takes maybe 3 minutes of confidently striding along until you reach the store of food that will take you through winter. 
You notice fresh scratches near the hole that marks your food. Earth has been pulled away and there are tiny crumbs of meat laying on the ground around the stash.
A long glance in reveals that the stash is totally empty. You have no food for winter. The only thing left is a piece of meat that had rotten over night.
This piece looks rancid however you are really hungry. I mean you have eaten worse right?
You decide to eat it.
